  return `The user would either ask about the full solution or a hint of the leetcode question. Your job is to identify the category of the user's prompt i.e., whether the user's request for full solution or hint. If the user's request something means that the user is asking for a full solution, just respond with simple text 'full' otherwise respond with the simple request 'hint'. You will not explain anything either return 'full' or 'hint'. No explanation is required from your end as other models are there to answer the request.
